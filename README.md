# Kotlin StateFlow
Sample Android application that show how can we use Kotlin Coroutines `StateFlow`.
## Implementation
`StateFlow` is a new class introduced in version 1.3.6 of the Kotlin Coroutines library which works in the following way:

- It's a `Flow` with a single updatable data value that emits updates to the value to its collectors.
- Updates to the value can be observed by collecting values from this flow.
- It's useful as a data-model class to represent any kind of state.
- It's designed to completely replace `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` in the future.

<br><br>
For example, the following class represents an integer state that increments its value by calling the method `incrementCount`:
```kt
class CountModel {
    private val _countState = MutableStateFlow(0) // Private mutable state flow
    val countState: StateFlow<Int> get() = _countState // Public read-only state flow

    fun incrementCount() {
        _countState.value++
    }
}
```
Now in a possible activity we can observe `countState` to keep track of its updates:
```kt
lifecycleScope.launch {
    countModel.countState.collect { value ->
        countTextView.text = "$value"
    }
}
```
This collector will be executed whenever the value of `countState` is updated. Also it's **lifecycle-aware** as weâ€™ve used it under `lifecycleScope`.
